				<h5 >Pandusthal Temple</h5>
				<p>Pandusthal is thought to be the site of the war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas. This area, which gives one of the most stunning vistas of the Himalayas, can only be reached after a 20-kilometer journey.
                    The Pandusthal’s view is so spectacular that you can even see the dangling glaciers near the peaks. To begin the trip, take a bus or a car from Bageshwar to Baisani (25 km). The walk begins at Baisani and lasts approximately 15 kilometers, which may be completed in one day. One can even stay overnight and explore the area before returning the next day.
